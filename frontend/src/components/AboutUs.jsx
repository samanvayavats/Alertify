                <p>At Alertify, we believe that timely information can save lives.
                    <br />
                    Born out of the need for a smarter, faster, and more community-driven response to emergencies, Alertify is more than just a platform â€” itâ€™s a movement to empower people during critical moments. Whether itâ€™s a landslide cutting off access to a village, a road accident that needs immediate attention, or a natural disaster threatening lives and infrastructure â€” Alertify gives every citizen the power to act.
                    <br />
                    We are a team of developers, designers, and socially conscious thinkers who saw a gap in how local emergencies are reported â€” especially in under-connected, rural, or disaster-prone areas. Thatâ€™s why we built a platform that is simple to use, map-based, image-enabled, and mobile-first, ensuring that anyone, anywhere can raise an alert with just a few taps.
                    <br />
                    Our mission is to create a more informed, responsive, and safer society by connecting individuals with the right people at the right time â€” using real-time location data and community participation.</p>
